# UMDAC---Datathon

## Overview 
This project addresses a cash flow forecasting and monitoring challenge for a multi-entity, multi-currency business operating across regions. Due to varying billing cycles, customer payment behavior, and routine vendor payments, cash inflows and outflows fluctuate over time, making short-term liquidity visibility critical for finance teams.

The objective is to provide reliable short-term cash flow forecasts, ending cash balance visibility, and early detection of irregular transactions through data analysis, forecasting models, and an interactive dashboard.

## Objective
- Analyze historical cash inflows and outflows across legal entities and categories
- Visualize weekly net cash flow and ending cash balances
- Forecast weekly net cash flow and cash balance up to 6 months ahead
- Compare forecasted vs actual cash flows and evaluate model accuracy
- Detect anomalous cash flow activities that may require business review
- Translate analytical results into actionable insights for finance stakeholders
